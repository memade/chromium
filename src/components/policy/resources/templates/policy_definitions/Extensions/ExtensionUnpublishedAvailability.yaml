  If the policy is set to <ph name="DISABLE_UNPUBLISHED_EXCEPT_FORCED_OR_VERSION_PINNED">DisableUnpublishedExceptForcedOrVersionPinned</ph> (1), extensions that are unpublished on the Chrome Wesb Store will be disabled, but not if the extension is force-installed or version-pinned by enterprise policy (See Note).
  If the policy is set to <ph name="DISABLE_UNPUBLISHED">DisableUnpublished</ph> (2), extensions that are unpublished on the Chrome Web Store will be disabled, even if the extension is force-installed or version-pinned by enterprise policy (See Note).

  Note: Force-installation and version-pinning are configured using the <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_FORCELIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallForcelist</ph> and
  <ph name="EXTENSION_SETTINGS_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionSettings</ph> policies.
